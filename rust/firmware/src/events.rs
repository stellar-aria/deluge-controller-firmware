//! Hardware event bus — shared between input tasks and the CDC task.
//!
//! Input tasks (`pic_task`, `encoder_task`) push events here with
//! [`try_send`][embassy_sync::channel::Channel::try_send].  The CDC task
//! drains the channel and encodes each event as a `MessageFromDeluge` frame.
//!
//! Channel capacity is 32; overflow silently drops events, matching the
//! C firmware's rx-buffer-discard flow-control policy.
