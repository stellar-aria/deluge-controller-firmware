//! MIDI/CV gate one-shot timer using MTU2 channel 2.
//!
//! The Deluge uses a hardware timer to schedule precise gate-off (or gate-on)
//! events that must occur at a sub-millisecond offset within an audio render
//! window — too fine-grained for the Embassy `Timer` abstraction, which has
//! ~30 µs resolution and requires executor context.
//!
//! ## Mechanism
//! MTU2 channel 2, clocked at P0/64 ≈ **520.833 kHz** (~1.92 µs per tick), is
//! configured in one-shot compare-match mode.  When the counter reaches TGRA
//! it automatically resets (CCLR = TGRA), fires the `TGI2A` GIC interrupt
//! (ID 150, priority 5), and calls `handler()`, which:
//!
//! 1. Clears the MTU2 compare-match flag (TSR.TGFA).
//! 2. Reads the pending action from `STATE`.
//! 3. Executes the action (e.g. de-assert a gate GPIO).
//! 4. Disarms the timer (stops ch2, masks GIC ID 150).
//!
//! ## Tick frequency
//! `MTU2_P0_HZ` (33.333 MHz) / 64 = **520 833 Hz** → 1 tick ≈ **1.92 µs**.
//! Maximum one-shot delay: 65535 ticks ≈ **125.9 ms**.
//!
//! ## Usage
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use deluge_bsp::midi_gate;
//!
//! // Once at startup (after gic::init() and mtu2::enable_write()):
//! unsafe { midi_gate::setup(); }
//!
//! // At render time, to de-assert gate 0 in 520 ticks (~1 ms):
//! unsafe { midi_gate::schedule_gate_off(0, 520); }
//!
//! // To cancel a pending shot (e.g. note extended):
//! unsafe { midi_gate::cancel(); }
//! ```
