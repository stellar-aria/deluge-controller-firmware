//! OS Timer (OSTM) driver for the RZ/A1L.
//!
//! The RZ/A1L has two OSTM channels, each a 32-bit timer clocked by P0
//! (33.33 MHz = CPU / 12).
//!
//! Two operating modes (OSTMnCTL bits):
//!   - Interval timer (CTL = 0x00): counts down from CMP, fires interrupt at 0
//!   - Free-running  (CTL = 0x02): counts up from 0, optionally fires at CMP
//!
//! ## Usage
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use rza1::ostm;
//! # use rza1::ostm::OSTM_HZ;
//! unsafe {
//!     ostm::enable_clock();          // ungate OSTM0+OSTM1 in CPG
//!     ostm::start_free_running(0);   // start OSTM0 in free-running mode
//!     let t0 = ostm::count(0);
//!     // ... wait ~1 s ...
//!     while ostm::count(0).wrapping_sub(t0) < OSTM_HZ {}
//! }
//! ```
